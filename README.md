# HeyFriend

**Talk it out. Think it through.**  
HeyFriend is a voice-first mental health companion that lets you speak openly with AI, receive compassionate responses in real time, and reflect on your thoughts through meaningful post-session insights.

> **Designed to be Graduated From** — the goal is to help you build self-awareness, resilience, and healthier thought patterns so you eventually need it less.

---

## 🌟 Overview

HeyFriend is a lightweight mobile app that enables you to:

- Speak freely about what’s on your mind in a **voice-first chat**.
- Receive **empathetic AI responses** powered by GPT.
- View **post-chat summaries** with emotional and linguistic trends.
- Track your growth over time in the **Insights Tab**.

This is **not** a replacement for clinical therapy.  
It’s a reflection tool for everyday emotional regulation and self-awareness.

## 🎯 Target Audience

HeyFriend is built for individuals who:

- Prefer **private, tech-driven support**.
- Struggle to maintain a journaling habit.
- Want something more personal and reflective than standard journaling apps.
- Seek daily emotional check-ins and mindset improvement.
